Dear Madam/Sir,
\\
\\
I am writing to apply for the position of machine learning engineer at Ocono GmbH. I am graduating during the summer of 2018 in computer science with a specialization in machine learning. I want to pursue a career in data analysis with a focus on machine learning and natural language processing.
\\
\\
I work in computing similarities in graphical and text data to build a recommendation system as part of my master's thesis. To achieve that, I use a combination of text mining, matrix factorization (latent semantic indexing), neural network, and optimization techniques. The matrix factorization technique which reduces the rank of a matrix works well to learn hidden relations in document-term matrix but learning these embeddings using neural network helps me achieve a better similarity. For the multiple sources of text/tokens, I learn importance weights using gradient descent on these sources to combine them to attain a better similarity score. Before this task, I finished a project in brain-signals classification which generates artificial brain signals using the original ones by doing mathematical transformations. In order to reduce overfitting due to less number of original brain signals, I used a regularized variant of linear discriminant analysis for classification. I love to contribute to open-source software, 
\href{https://usegalaxy.org/} {Galaxy}, for my research assistant work.
\\
\\
In addition, I want to be the part of a small team which leads to quality personal interaction with the coworkers and provides a conducive environment for better learning. Hence, the job position will provide me a great opportunity to improve my professional and personal skills.
\\
\\
Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.
\\
\\
Sincerely, \\
Anup Kumar \newline
