Dear Madam/Sir,
\\
\\
I am writing to apply for the position of Machine Learning Engineer at Picnic. I am graduating during the summer of 2018 in Computer Science with a specialization in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I want to pursue a career in data analysis with a focus on natural language processing and machine learning.
\\
\\
I work in graphical and text data clustering to build a recommendation system for my master's thesis. To cluster text, I use matrix factorization, neural network, and optimization techniques. The matrix factorization technique which reduces the rank of a matrix works well to learn hidden relations in document-term matrix but learning these embeddings using neural network achieves a better accuracy. For the multiple sources of text/tokens, I learn importance weights in order to combine them optimally to compute a overall better similarity score using gradient descent. Before this task, I finished a project in brain-signals classification which generates artificial brain signals using the original ones by doing mathematical transformations. In order to reduce overfitting due to less number of original brain signals, I used a regularized variant of linear discriminant analysis for classification. Moreover, I contribute to open-source software, 
\href{https://usegalaxy.org/} {Galaxy}, for my research assistant job.
\\
\\
The requirements for the job position will provide me a great opportunity to improve my professional and personal skills.
\\
\\
Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.
\\
\\
Sincerely, \\
Anup Kumar \newline
