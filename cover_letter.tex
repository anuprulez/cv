\greetto{Dear Madam/Sir,}

\begin{document}
\begin{newlfm}

I am writing to apply for the position of Machine Learning Engineer at Picnic. I am graduating during the summer of 2018 in Computer Science with a specialization in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I want to pursue a career in data analysis with a focus on natural language processing and machine learning.

I work in graphical and text data clustering to build a recommendation system for my master's thesis. To cluster text, I use matrix factorization, neural network, and optimization techniques. I finished a project in brain-signals classification which generates artificial brain signals using the original ones by doing mathematical transformations. Moreover, I contribute to open-source software, Galaxy (https://usegalaxy.org/), for my research assistant job.

The requirements for the job position will provide me a great opportunity to improve my professional and personal skills.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to
hearing from you.

\closeline{Sincerely,}
\namefrom{Anup Kumar}
